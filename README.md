This repository is an ongoing personal project that uses web scraping tools and data analysis to explore data on espnfc.com regarding corner kicks on different european leagues.

It has two main parts:

- Web scraping, where the data is extracted from the website and appended to the main data file
- Calculations, where the analysis using that data is done
